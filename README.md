## Cats, Cats, Cats! 🐱🐱🐱

Because why not, here are some fun ASCII cats to keep things silly:

```
 /\_/\  
( o.o ) 
 > ^ <  
```

```
 |\---/|
 | ,_, |
  \_`_/-..----.
 ___/ `   ' ,""+ \  sk
(__...'   __\    |`.___.';
 (_,...'(_,.`__)/'.....+
```

And don't forget:

```

## A Silly Reminder

Just a friendly reminder: **Don't be an asshole!** Stealing is never cool, and it's a pretty *lame* thing to do. It's against the community spirit, and **Valkie** deserves respect. If you think it's okay to steal code, **you’re not doing it right**. **Don’t be that person.**

Valkie is meant to be **customizable**, and we want people to *create their own versions*. But **keep the credit intact**! If you fork the code, add your features, or just want to make it your own, that’s awesome — just **make sure Valkie’s core spirit is respected**. 

Remember: We’re all in this together to build cool stuff, not to take shortcuts or be jerks. Stealing code or misusing it isn’t just *lame*, it’s against the rules of the open-source community!

Let’s keep things fun, open, and collaborative!

**Valkie** - Your Personal Assistant 🐾

And remember, if Valkie ever needs to take a nap, it’s okay to let her sleep:

```
sleep()
```

She’ll be back when you need her. 😉

Stay silly, stay awesome, and always be kind to your code and your community. 😸

```
|\_/\
